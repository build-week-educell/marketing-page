          <h2>WHAT WE DO</h2>
          <p>
            We help schools and teachers in Africa to use low-cost technology
            and free instructional materials to improve outcomes in their
            classrooms. Our partner-teachers leverage digital assessments to
            instantly understand student needs, and multimedia instructional
            materials to personalize instruction for every student. We install
            the technology, train the teachers, and provide the instructional
            material. Check out our Projects page to see some examples of our
            work.

          <h2>Project G.M.A.D.</h2>
          <p>
            Ghana Make A Difference (GMAD) is an NGO that provides housing and
            basic necessities for children who have been rescued from human
            trafficking, abuse, and neglect. Dissatisfied with the community
            school, GMAD constructed a new school to serve their children and
            others in the community. The GMAD Accademy of Learning employed
            three full-time teachers, a special-needs teacher, and a vocational
            trainer. They served approximately 60 students. Teachers and
            students initially had limited competency with technology like
            computers and tablets. One of the unique challenges at GMAD is that
            students typically spend one year in the program, and enter and exit
            the program at unpredictable times.
